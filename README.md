# codedojo
I'm holding a series of monthly Code Dojos. Below will be a small introduction to each Code Dojo and I will publish the solution in this repository. When specify, the challenge files will be in respective folder. The solutions will be in basic C++ 14 if not specified.

I publish articles where I go through the code at https://dev.to/nchrisz

## First

A town have been infested by zombies. To best combat them you need to find out how many groups there are active in the town. A grid will represent a town where a 0 is a human and a 1 is a zombie. Adjacent number, horizontal or vertical, mean they are part of the same group.

Example

10
01

is a town with 4 creatures, 2 humans and 2 zombies. As the 1 are not adjacent we have 2 zombie groups here.

Write a program that will take a grid and calculate how many groups of zombies there are. Solve the gird in folder one
